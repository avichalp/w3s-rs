## Chain writer
The w3s crate contains several writers for the upload tasks. You can put writers according to your needs.

For example, if you'd like to compress and encrypt your data before upload:
```
Get the file -> compression writer -> encryption writer -> split writer -> upload writer
```

If you'd like to upload a CAR file:
```
Get the file -> CAR writer -> upload writer
```

If you'd like to encrypt the file before CAR it and upload:
```
Get the file -> encryption writer -> CAR writer -> upload writer
```
